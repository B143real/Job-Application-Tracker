# Job Application Tracker

## Project Vision
The Job Application Tracker is a single-page web application designed to streamline the process of managing job applications. It allows users to efficiently add, edit, view, and track their applications, ensuring they stay organized and informed throughout their job search journey.

---

## Background
This idea was validated and enhanced during a Peer-Assisted Learning (PAL) session on **November 27, 2024**. During the session:
- The project was recognized as highly relevant for job seekers.
- Suggestions included implementing filtering/search functionality and a simple, visual progress tracker.
- It was recommended to start with a prototype focusing on core features, ensuring clarity and simplicity.

---

## Features
### **Core Functionalities**
1. Add, edit, and delete job applications.
2. View job application details in a table format.
3. Filter or search applications by criteria such as:
   - **Status:** Applied, Interview Scheduled, Offer Received, Rejected.
   - **Company** or **Date Applied**.
4. Persistent data storage using `localStorage`.
5. Track application progress visually using a progress bar.
6. Select **Date Applied** using a calendar picker for consistent date input.
7. **Form Validation:**
   - Ensures users complete required fields (e.g., "Job Title," "Company," "Status," and "Date Applied") before submission using HTML5's `required` attribute.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** Styling for a clean and user-friendly layout.
- **JavaScript:** Interactivity, data handling, and local storage integration.
- **PlantUML:** For system diagrams like Use Case, Class, and Sequence Diagrams.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/B143real/job-application-tracker.git
   ```
2. **Open the Application:**
   - Navigate to the project folder.
   - Open `index.html` in your browser to view the application.

3. **Test the Features:**
   - Add, edit, delete, and filter job applications.
   - View the progress bar for application tracking.
   - Select application dates using the calendar picker.
   - Experience built-in form validation for required fields.
   - Data is saved persistently using `localStorage`.

## Challenges and Solutions
### **Challenges:**
1. Ensuring data persistence without a backend.
2. Debugging filtering logic for complex user inputs.
3. Designing an intuitive and visually appealing UI.

### **Solutions:**
1. Used browser `localStorage` for lightweight and reliable data persistence.
2. Conducted iterative testing with mock data to validate filtering logic.
3. Enhanced the layout and functionality with CSS for a single-page application.

## Next Steps
1. Refine and test all implemented features to ensure seamless functionality.
2. Finalize design documentation to align with project implementation.
3. Record and prepare the interim video submission for January 2025.
4. Incorporate feedback from the interim submission into further improvements.
5. Prepare for the final presentation in May 2025, ensuring compliance with the single-page application requirement.
