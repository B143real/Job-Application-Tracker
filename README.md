# Job Application Tracker

## Project Vision
The Job Application Tracker is a single-page web application designed to streamline the process of managing job applications. It allows users to efficiently add, edit, view, and track their applications, ensuring they stay organized and informed throughout their job search journey.

---

## Background
This idea was validated and enhanced during a Peer-Assisted Learning (PAL) session on **November 27, 2024**. During the session:
- The project was recognized as highly relevant for job seekers.
- Suggestions included implementing filtering/search functionality and a simple, visual progress tracker.
- It was recommended to start with a prototype focusing on core features, ensuring clarity and simplicity.

---

## Features
### **Core Functionalities**
1. Add, edit, and delete job applications.
2. View job application details in a table format.
3. Filter or search applications by criteria such as:
   - **Status:** Applied, Interview Scheduled, Offer Received, Rejected.
   - **Company** or **Date Applied**.
4. Persistent data storage using `localStorage`.
5. Track application progress visually using a progress bar.

### **Future Enhancements**
- Drag-and-drop prioritization of applications.
- Advanced filtering and analytics options.
- Optimized design for mobile responsiveness.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** Styling for a responsive and user-friendly layout.
- **JavaScript:** Interactivity, data handling, and local storage integration.
- **PlantUML:** For system diagrams like Use Case, Class, and Sequence Diagrams.

## Challenges and Solutions
### **Challenges:**
1. Ensuring data persistence without a backend.
2. Debugging filtering logic for complex user inputs.
3. Designing a responsive and interactive UI.

### **Solutions:**
1. Used browser `localStorage` for lightweight and reliable data persistence.
2. Conducted iterative testing with mock data to validate filtering logic.
3. Applied CSS flexbox, media queries, and hover effects for a responsive and engaging design.
