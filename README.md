# Job Application Tracker

## Project Vision
The Job Application Tracker is a single-page web application designed to streamline the process of managing job applications. It enables users to efficiently add, edit, view, and track their applications, ensuring they stay organized and informed throughout their job search journey.

## Background
This idea was validated and enhanced during a Peer-Assisted Learning (PAL) session on **[Insert Date]**. During the session:
- The project was recognized as highly relevant for job seekers.
- Suggestions included implementing a filtering/search functionality and a simple, visual progress tracker.
- It was recommended to start with a prototype focusing on core features, ensuring clarity and simplicity.

## Features
1. **Core Functionalities**
   - Add, edit, and remove job applications.
   - View job application details in a table format.
   - Filter or search applications by criteria such as status, company, or date applied.
   - Track application progress visually (e.g., applied, interviewed, offer received).

2. **Future Enhancements**
   - Include browser-based local storage for persistent data.
   - Add drag-and-drop prioritization of applications.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and data handling.
